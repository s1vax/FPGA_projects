# 🖼️ Image Generator: Synthetic Street Scene

This project implements a synthetic video signal generator in VHDL. Its main function is to simulate the input from a camera for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), generating a road scene with movement and curves without the need for external capture hardware. This project was carried out using an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA (EP4CE22E22C7).

## 📂 Folder Content
  * **`street_image.vhd`**: The heart of the project. It generates VGA sync signals (640x480 @ 60Hz) and procedurally "draws" the scene.
     * **Generated elements:** Sky, grass and a gray road with a center line.
     * **Animation:** Simulate a curved road by calculating the variable center position (`center_pos`) line by line.

  * **`sim_street_image.vhd`**: Testbench designed to visually validate the generator.
     * It generates an `.ppm` (Portable Pixel Map) output file that allows you to see on your computer the exact image that the FPGA would send to the VGA monitor.

## 🚀 How to test & implement the Generator

This project does not require a real camera. You can view the output directly through simulation or remote labs (you can check this out on `Projects_Results/` of this repository):


* ***📌 Simulation on ModelSim:***

1.  **Open ModelSim:** Load the `sim_street_image.vhd` file and compile the project.
2.  **Run Simulation:** Run the simulation for at least 1 video frame (approx. 16.7ms).
3.  **Verify Output:** The testbench will create a file called `image_out.ppm`.
    * You can open this file with *IrfanView*, *GIMP* or online converters to see the synthetically generated road.

⚠️ ***Clarification:*** To resolve doubts about how to perform the first steps and configure the simulation in ModelSim, consult the detailed guide in the `Lane_detection_C_V` directory of this repository.

* ***📌 Implementation on Quartus Prime & FPGA board:***
1. Load the `street_image.vhd` and `lane_default_Cyclone_IV.qsf` (pin map) files into Quartus Prime, and run the Synthesis.
2. Once we have obtained the .bit file `street_image.sof` from the Synthesis (located in the output_files directory of your Quartus-Project on our computer), we can now run it on our FPGA or Remote Lab.

⚠️ ***Clarification:*** To resolve doubts about how to perform the first steps and configuration of the implementation in Quartus Prime, consult the detailed guide in the `Lane_detection_C_V` directory of this repository.

  ### 🕵️ We can add an extra: Processing Modules (Lane Detection)
*This folder also includes the same files found in the FPGA `Lane_detection_C_V` project (from this same repository), so we can apply its algorithm to `Image_Generator_C_IV`:*
* **`lane.vhd`**: Upper entity that takes the video signal and applies lane detection.
* **`lane_sobel.vhd`**: Implementation of the Sobel filter to detect lanes.
* **`lane_linemem.vhd`**: Line buffer for 3x3 window processing.

## ⚙️ VGA Technical Details
The generator follows the industrial VGA timing standard:
* **Pixel Clock:** 25 MHz.
* **Active Resolution:** 640 x 480 pixels.
* **Synchronization:** Manual generation of `h_sync` and `v_sync` pulses based on counters.
